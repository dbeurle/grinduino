Nuova Simonelli MDX coffee grinder with Arduino control.

Note - this is for self-educational purposes only.  I am not an electrical engineer!

## Overview

This project is intended to provide Arduino control for a doser style grinder with an on-off switch.  An interface will allow the use of three timings; single dose, double dose and a purge function.  The purge function allows the stale grounds that have accumulated in the chute of the grinder to be flushed out.  Each of these functions will be able to be modified through a display and three button inputs.

For testing purposes, an Arduino will be used to handle the logic and the onboard LED will server as the 'motor' state.
